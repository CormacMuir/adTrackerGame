The plan for today is to attempt to get a live ad counter running, this means that i'll write some js to a)manipulate chrome storage to keep track of the number of ads encountered throughout the browsing session and b) to dynamically update popup.html to create a live tracker.

Previous task completed, going to see if I can now implement a very rudimentary stick or twist game using 2 buttons.
